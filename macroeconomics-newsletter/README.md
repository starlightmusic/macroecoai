# Macroeconomics Newsletter Website

This site provides an AI-powered macroeconomics newsletter with a free beta subscription. The site uses vanilla HTML, Tailwind CSS, and minimal JavaScript.

## Development
Open the `index.html` file in a browser to preview locally. All assets are relative so no build step is required.

## Deployment
Deploy the `macroeconomics-newsletter` directory to Cloudflare Pages. The `_redirects` file handles friendly URLs. Forms submit to Formspree endpoints and redirect to `success.html`.
